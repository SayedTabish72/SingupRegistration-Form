Providing your customers with simple sign-up and registration forms on your website is essential for capturing leads, growing your email list, and boosting overall sales.  Thereâ€™s just one problem: HTML.  HTML5 is the standard code used to make most web pages work. It's the language of the internet. But like any programming languageâ€”from Javascript and jquery to PHP and CSS3â€”there's a steep learning curve, especially if you've never touched any code.  Fear not. We're here to help. We might be able to turn you into Bill Gates overnight, but with the help of some useful examples, by the end of this tutorial, you'll be ready to create a basic registration form using HTML in no time.
